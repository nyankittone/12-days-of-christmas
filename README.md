This is a simple little Rust program that prints out the lyrics to the twelve days of Christmas.
This is one of the exersices mentioned by the Rust book, hence why I did it, since I'm currenttly
learning the language.

The code is pretty basic, but hey, what else do you expect from someone new to a language? :3
